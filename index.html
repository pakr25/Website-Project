      <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
      <p>Learn about healthy food options! This blog will open your mind to new worlds of flavor. The creators Henna Patel and Ryan Pak have put a refreshing perspective on healthy foods.
        They have carefully made this website from scratch for Intro to Computer Science at Rock Canyon High School. We were asked to create a website about something that we are passionate about. Because we like
        healthy food, and the fact that we both are vegetarian, we came up with an idea very quickly. Enjoy our website and eat healthy!</p>
